                    <b>Right Here! Right Now!</b> is the third project in the course <b>CS 424: Visualization and Visual Analytics</b>under Prof. Andrew Johnson at University of Illinois at Chicago(UIC). The project is continuation of the ongoing focus of the class on demographics and communities in Chicago, Illinois. Project 3 is called Right Here! Right Now! as our primary focus this time is 311 Data offered by the City of Chicago alongside public transit systems available to the public and how to efficiently show that data to the user and let the user filter information from it. 
                    <br>
                    </p>

                   <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <p>
                    <b>Right Here! Right Now!</b> is the third project in the CS 424 : Visualization and Visual Analytics course at University of Illinois at Chicago(UIC). The focus of the project is to make an interactive application displaying the 311 data available from city of Chicago and also the various transit systems like CTA Bus System and Divvy Bike Sharing System.

                    <p>
                    The goal of the project was to create an application which can be used by an user to travel through and discover Chicago in the best possible way. To aid the user to make decisions, we give the user various types of relevant data. The data is split into various layers which can be toggled on and off so that the user always has the control over what he/she wants to explore. The Layers on our application are various types of 311 data, Divvy Bike Stations and CTA Tracker. We wanted to give the user the option of not only able to decide if his/her interests but also discover new places of interest. Along with the various points of interest, We wanted to give the user option of seeing the various public transit systems around his point of interest. <br>Listed below are the various types of views the user can show from.
                    <br>

                    <p>
                    At the same time, the user may or may not care about overall city of Chicago and may be concerned about seeing information only in a certain community/neighbourhood of Chicago or maybe want to check whats available near by. For this specific purpose, We have incorporated various modes in our application. The user can choose to view information of the below given modes.
                    <ul>Modes
                        <li>Path Mode</li>
                            <p> The user picks his start and ending destination points and we give the user the route along major streets. We have designed the application in such a manner that the user can even choose the path he/she wants to take by simply dragging the path and it automatically routes to the new route. To keep the data relevant, we have chosen a 2 block radius to show data along the path created. This way the user can know whether that particular route is safe or not and can actually compare between routes.</p>
                        <li>Box Mode</li>
                            <p> The user picks two points and the user will be able to see data in the selected box. The boundary shows the selected region. This allows the user to see data in a much larger area and see what is around and about.</p>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Along with the different layers, we have visualizations for all the 311 data which allows the user to quickly see if the statistics of the selected area versus the statistics of city of chicago. The visualizations are broken down into last week and last month so that the user can see a trend between different times and between the area and the city itself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We have tried to create the application from an user's point of view and tried to incorporate things which would help the user navigate and discover new points of interest and in general give the user a sense of how the city is in the selected area. 311 data is a big deal in Chicago and it being public is a huge plus. Through our application , we hope that users have a more usable and friendly interface to access this and discover this beautiful city of Chicago.

                    <li>Though abandon vehicles seem to be prevalent around the city, there is a ring around downtown, particularly pronounced on the near south side, where these cars don't exist or have been cleared.<br />

                    <li>The Hamlin Park / North Center area (from Belmont to Montrose between Western and Ashland) seems to be one of the few areas in the city that excells at keeping their streetlights on:<br />

                    <li>Crime reports are much more evenly distributed around the city than we expected them to be.  From believing the accepted stereotypes, we would expect crime to be much worse in certain areas than others, but that does not seem to be the case:<br />

	              <h3>Soda API</h3>
                <p> Soda API is the API for all the 311 data being used for this project. Each layer had to be shown on the map and had to be sub-divided on the basis of two different times- last week and last month which made sense as it had to be relevant to the user using the application. Along with showing data subdivided based on time, each marker on the map also shows various tidbits on each layer.
                  </p>

                The objective of the project was to display the Following are the data sources which are being fulled using Soda API.
